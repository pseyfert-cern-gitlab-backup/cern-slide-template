# disclaimer

Copyright of all cited works remains with the original copyright holders.

# final slides

The slides are not published under a free license. They may not be reused or
distributed outside of the group within which they are shown (mostly LHCb),
usage of the material within that group must be done with attribution of the
original author, and the restriction of redistribution and attribution must
apply to the derived work, too.

# source material

Source material remains under the original license and terms of usage

To be sure, look up the original material.

# double licensing and material not yet covered

The above rules for the final slides apply also to any material included in
the slides that is not yet covered by the rules for source material. Code
is an exception here, notably:

 - `Makefile`
 - `gitlab-ci.yml`

These are considered more program like than creative-content like, and
published under the [AGPL 3](AGPL.txt).
